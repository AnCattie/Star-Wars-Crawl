      <h4>The BeCode story </h4>
      <h6>By An Cattie & Quinn Loots</h6>

        <p>It all started on the 17th of October. We were selected to joing the journey of BeCode Genk - Hopper.</p>
        <p>On the first day we assembled our workplace with brand new chairs and got to know eachother by personal question games.</p>
        <p>On the second day we've installed the operating systems of our laptops and personalized it with a BeCode-sticker.</p>
        <p>We've learned a lot of new skills, working with different coding-programs.</p>
        <p>Also we've learned a new coding-language with "GIT".</p>
        <p>We've also learned how to network on Linkedin, Ryver, etc.</p>
        <p>We also work all as a team and no one gets behind.</p>
        <p>each day we keep learning each day.</p>
